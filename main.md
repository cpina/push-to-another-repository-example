title: "Test with Pandoc using Github Actions"
---

# Hello
This repository is an example on how to use a Github Action.

It has a Markdown file and using a Github Action uses Pandoc to generate HTML, PDF, etc. and pushes the generated files into another Github repo.

Now it has stricter shell options.

And now... names in entrypoint.sh and names in action.yml are aligned.

Testing now with the COMMIT_MESSAGE (default)

Now testing with --set-upstream

Now testing after https://github.com/cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository/pull/41

Now testing after adding support for github hosts other than github.com (again)
