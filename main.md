title: "Test with Pandoc using Github Actions"
---

# Hello
This repository is an example on how to use a Github Action.

It has a Markdown file and using a Github Action uses Pandoc to generate HTML, PDF, etc. and pushes the generated files into another Github repo.

Now it has stricter shell options.

And now... names in entrypoint.sh and names in action.yml are aligned.
